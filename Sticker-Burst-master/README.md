# Sticker Bros!

## Build Setup

``` bash
# clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/MeeraWakim/Sticker-Burst.git

# install dependencies
npm install

# run project on localhost:8080
npm run dev

```
Once the npm run dev command runs, you should be able to explore and use our entire website on localhost:8080 (or whichever address your terminal says) in your browser of choice (preferably chrome) with no issues.

NOTE: If you don't have npm, get it here: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
